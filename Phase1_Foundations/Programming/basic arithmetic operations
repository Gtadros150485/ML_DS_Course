a + b
Add a and b
a - b
Subtract b from a
a * b
Multiply a by b
a / b
Divide a by b
a // b
Floor-divide a by b, dropping any fractional remainder
a ** b
Raise a to the b power
a & b
True if both a and b are True; for integers, take the bitwise AND
a | b
True if either a or b is True; for integers, take the bitwise OR
a ^ b
For Booleans, True if a or b is True, but not both; for integers, take the bitwise EXCLUSIVE-OR
a == b
True if a equals b
a != b
True if a is not equal to b
a < b, a <= b
True if a is less than (less than or equal to) b
a > b, a >= b True if a is greater than (greater than or equal to) b
a is b
True if a and b reference the same Python object
a is not b
True if a and b reference different Python objects
